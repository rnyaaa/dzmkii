    Texture Generation
        - Smaller noise scale/perlin
        - Different textures depending on distance from origin
            - Ordinary Nature close 
            - Aberrations further 
            - Gradient of probability between the biome transitions

        -> material index { filled }

           |
           |
    Foliage Generation
        - Even smaller noise scale/perlin
        - Different foliage depending on underlying material index

        -> foliage index { filled }
